# Welcome to my plant processor
The purpose of this application is to try my hand at making a fullstack webapp from scratch. \n
Obviously it's not the greatest and most secure, but it is a start.\n
The web stack I used was:\n
  -basic frontend, (HTML, CSS)\n
  -Flask server\n
  -PostgreSQL database
