The purpose of this is to basically make my plant tracker into a website

Some things I still need to do:
    - Templates
        - Figure out a feed to view other people's plants
    - Responsive Styling
        - Figure out weird styling on plant.jinja
    - Check secutiry issues requesting other users data
    - Deploy?
