The purpose of this is to basically make my plant tracker into a website

Some things I still need to do:
    - Migrate from postgreSQL to mongoDB
    - Start using Flask templates
    - Possible openAI API integration?
        - https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview
    - Figure out saving images from a form
