        <h1>What is it?</h1>
        <p>
            After picking up my first plant right before moving into my college apartment, I was wondering if I would have a way to be able to remember when it needed to be watered.
            However, it really wasn't an issue for just ONE plant. <br><br> But now, my veritable army of four seems like it requires a lot more attention and bookkeeping when it comes to watering.
            Therefore, I decided to take it upon myself to make some sort of application to keep track of said waterings. <br><br>
            It just so happens that I'm currently enrolled in an internet programming course, and what better way to keep track of plants than with a fullstack web application? (That's what I tell myself at least)
            Thus, Peter's Plant Processor was born.

            Once this is actually finished, it will be a way for me to log in from anywhere and update information about my plants.<br><br>
            Not only to update information, but also see about when certain plants need to be watered and what kinds of conditions they should live in.
